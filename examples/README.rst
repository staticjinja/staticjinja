Examples
========

The entry point for each of the included examples is the shell script
``build.sh``. This may either use ``staticjinja`` from the CLI directly, or it
may use a ``build.py`` script for more complicated builds.

Each example uses ``build/`` as the output directory. So that you don't have to
actually run the examples to see what happens, each example shows what the
expected output is in the ``build-EXPECTED/`` directory.
